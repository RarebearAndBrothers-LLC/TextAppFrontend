Setup Redux and React Router. 
  
React Router:

Redux is a bit more involved, will refrence old project to see how setup worked, also this resource seems useful:

Once Redux is setup we need to hookup some login components and check to see if login works. 
Need to also start thinking about deploying to Heroku. I want to be able to download the app, login and see an index page of anything.

redux setup, router check, make login forms, check to see if user can be created and persisted, decide next after...

installing thunk and some other redux libraries to help build app.

remember, we just need to get login working from the frontend.

learning about thunk:

There is a lot going on rn, I think we should try to break this up; 
1.) React Router working within redux
    -> As far as I understand, we need to simply wrap <Router /> with <Provider store={store} /> so that Router has access to the redux store in all its routes 
2.) Redux setup 
    -> The ahrd part here is everyone has different ways of setting up the boiler pate and its hard to stay consistent. MAybe the best solution is to spend a few hours reading and review ONE source for this, Dan Abramov? 
3.) Thunk, lodash, etc. 
    -> So there are a bunhc of libraries people use in conjunction with redux and router. Some examples setup redux with these and some dont. The inconsistency is what is making this difficult. Maybe instead of setting it up to add a text we should be setting it up to add a user to login.

Conclusion: Setup using Redux docs, setup for user login NOT for adding a text message. 
Action item -> Review Redux Docs 

Update: Can we setup redux rect router all at once with login? Should we write a blog on this? 
    -> https://medium.com/@pamit/building-a-todo-app-using-react-redux-and-rails-fa260ebbdc44

    seems like everyone likes to make ToDo apps.. 

if we set this up maybe we can better understand login after? 
 ->  https://medium.com/@pamit/todo-list-building-a-react-app-with-rails-api-7a3027907665

 this is awesome, lets build a ToDo app and set it up that way so we have some refrence to add what we actuall want. We can keep the ToDos and make the app work that way.
